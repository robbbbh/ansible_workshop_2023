# Lab 2 - Installing a Database & its Dependencies

Once you have completed each exercise, run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook database.yml` command.


## Exercise 1

Use the `ansible.builtin.yum` module to install the mariadb server and its dependencies. This will require you to install the packages:
* mariadb-server
* python3-PyMySQL

Use the [ansible.builtin.yum](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/yum_module.html) documentation to see the modules usage.

Edit the following code snippet in `databse.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Install mariadb-server & python3-PyMySQL
    ansible.builtin.yum:
        # your solution
```

## Exercise 2

Use the `ansible.builtin.service` module to start and enable the mariadb database. 

Use the [ansible.builtin.service](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/service_module.html) documentation to see the modules usage.

Edit the following code snippet in `database.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Start and enable the mariadb service
    ansible.builtin.service:
      # Your solution
```

## Exercise 3

Use the `community.mysql.mysql_user` to change the root password. Mariadb server installs with default login_user of root and no password. To secure this user as part of an idempotent playbook, you must create at least two tasks: 1) change the root userâ€™s password, without providing any login_user/login_password details, 2) drop a ~/.my.cnf file containing the new root credentials. Subsequent runs of the playbook will then succeed by reading the new credentials from the file.

Use the [community.mysql.mysql_user](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/mysql/mysql_user_module.html#ansible-collections-community-mysql-mysql-user-module) documentation to see the modules usage.

Edit the following code snippet in `database.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Set Mysql root password
    community.mysql.mysql_user:
    login_user: root
    login_password: password
    name: root
    check_implicit_admin: true
    password: password
    host:

```

## Run Your code!

Once you have completed each exercise, run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook database.yml` command. 

If the playbook runs successfully, try using the `mysql` command to connect to the database. (e.g: mysql -h mydb.host -u username -p).
