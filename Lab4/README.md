# Lab 4 - Riding the Happy Train!

Good job on making it to Lab 4, now we can get on board the happy train!

## Exercise 1

Simply run the `happy_train.yml` playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook happy_train.yml
```

Once that has completed, use `ssh` to log into the `app` servers defined in your inventory.

```bash
ssh my.app.server
```

Once logged into the app server, type the `sl` command and enjoy the happy train!

```bash
sl
```
